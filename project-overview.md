# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Sentient Toaster Oven

Description: A web application that mocks a digital pet - but instead of a dog or cat, it's a sentient toaster oven! Users can "feed" it different types of bread, "play" by setting different cooking functions, and "train" it by teaching it new recipes (all mocked on the frontend, of course!). The system does not support any backend, so we will have to mock any backend.

Features:
*   Mock Feeding: Users select bread types (bagel, toast, croissant) and the toaster oven shows an animation of "eating" it.
*   Mock Playtime: Users select cooking functions (toast, bake, broil) and the toaster oven displays different visual effects.
*   Mock Training: Users input new recipes, and the toaster oven "learns" them, displaying the recipe on its digital display.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
